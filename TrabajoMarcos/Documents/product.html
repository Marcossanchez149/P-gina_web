            Our Products follow the Jewelry Regulations of the United States:
            <br>*ASTM Standards
            ASTM International is an organization that develops and publishes standards for a wide range of products,
            materials, and systems.
            ASTM’s standards currently number over 12,000, and cover industries such as toys and cosmetics, and personal
            care.
            In this section, we introduce two ASTM standards for jewelry for adults and children.
            <br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            <br>*ASTM F2999 – Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Adult Jewelry
            ASTM F2999 establishes test methods and requirements for specific elements and certain mechanical hazards in
            adult jewelry.
            <br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            <br>*ASTM F2923 – Standard Specification for Consumer Product Safety for Children’s Jewelry
            ASTM F2923 establishes test methods and requirements for specific elements and certain mechanical hazards in
            children’s jewelry.
            <br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            <br>*Due care
            The USDA APHIS notes that due care should be exercised when importing regulated products, but does not
            specify what should be done in exercising “due care”.
            Regardless, due care is defined as how much care a reasonable person takes under the same or similar
            circumstances.
            In this situation, if you are a US importer, you should exercise due care when determining the best way to
            verify how legitimate your supply chain of jewelry made of regulated products is.
            You should also take care when determining how legal any subsequent transactions are, as well as obey any
            laws in the US and abroad about plant protection and other conservation laws.
            <br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            <br>*ASTM standards
            The CPSIA requires that importers and manufacturers of children’s jewelry must ensure that their products
            are compliant with all applicable and substance restrictions and standards. Such standards, for example,
            include ASTM F2923.
            Note that ASTM F2923 on children’s jewelry does not include toy jewelry, such as jewelry that is used with a
            doll or stuffed animal. Instead, such products must comply with ASTM F963 for children’s toy products.
            <br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            <br>*CPSIA testing
            The CPSC requires that importers or manufacturers hire a CPSC-approved third-party testing company to verify
            compliance of jewelry products intended for children with all requirements before importing and selling
            them.
            In most cases, when you request a quotation from a CPSC-accepted testing company, the company will also help
            you to determine which standards are applicable to your product. This can be very helpful when importing a
            new product and material, as it’s not always an easy task to assess applicable standards.
            <br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            <br>*Children’s Product Certificate (CPC)
            Importers and manufacturers of children’s jewelry products must certify, in a written Children’s Product
            Certificate (CPC) based on test results from a CPSC-accepted lab-testing company, that their children’s
            jewelry complies with applicable children’s product safety rules. The importers and manufacturers are
            responsible for drafting and issuing the CPC.
